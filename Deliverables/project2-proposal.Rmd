Questions 

1. Is there a significant linear relationship between year built and square footage? 

2. Can we predict whether a house is on a waterfront based on other qualities? Square footage, # bedrooms, # bathrooms, sqft_living15, condition, grade. 

 

Data visualizations 

Abner 

1. Histogram square footage frequency (few observations on one end or the other may skew results) 

2. Boxplot â€“ density of data at different values (shows distribution of data) - condition or grade based on waterfront or not 

Alexandra 

1. Histogram year built and square footage, checking for skews (single variable visualization, year built and frequency) 

2. Scatterplot: Square footage against number of bed rooms, color=waterfront 

John 

1. Scatter plot between year built and square footage to show individual data points  
2. Histogram for each variable split by waterfront status, to visualize the frequency of values  

 

Have everything done by November 11 so we can do a final check before submitting.
